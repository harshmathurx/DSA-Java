# Intro to Trees

## Trees are non-recursive data structures.

## ***A tree*** is also one of the data structures that represent hierarchical data.

# **Tree Terminologies**

# **Root**

- In a tree data structure, the root is the first node of the tree. The root node is the initial node of the tree in data structures.
- In the tree data structure, there must be only one root node.

# **Edge**

- In a tree in data structures, the connecting link of any two nodes is called the edge of the tree data structure.
- In the tree data structure, N number of nodes connecting with N -1 number of edges.

# **Parent**

In the tree in data structures, the node that is the predecessor of any node is known as a parent node, or a node with a branch from itself to any other successive node is called the parent node.

# **Child**

- The node, a descendant of any node, is known as child nodes in data structures.
- In a tree, any number of parent nodes can have any number of child nodes.
- In a tree, every node except the root node is a child node.

# **Siblings**

In trees in the data structure, nodes that belong to the same parent are called siblings.

# **Leaf**

- Trees in the data structure, the node with no child, is known as a leaf node.
- In trees, leaf nodes are also called external nodes or terminal nodes.

# **Internal nodes**

- Trees in the data structure have at least one child node known as internal nodes.
- In trees, nodes other than leaf nodes are internal nodes.
- Sometimes root nodes are also called internal nodes if the tree has more than one node.

# **Degree**

- In the tree data structure, the total number of children of a node is called the degree of the node.
- The highest degree of the node among all the nodes in a tree is called the Degree of Tree.

# **Level**

In tree data structures, the root node is said to be at level 0, and the root node's children are at level 1, and the children of that node at level 1 will be level 2, and so on.

# **Height**

- In a tree data structure, the number of edges from the leaf node to the particular node in the longest path is known as the height of that node.
- In the tree, the height of the root node is called "Height of Tree".
- The tree height of all leaf nodes is 0.

# **Depth**

- In a tree, many edges from the root node to the particular node are called the depth of the tree.
- In the tree, the total number of edges from the root node to the leaf node in the longest path is known as "Depth of Tree".
- In the tree data structures, the depth of the root node is 0.

# **Path**

- In the tree in data structures, the sequence of nodes and edges from one node to another node is called the path between those two nodes.
- The length of a path is the total number of nodes in a path.zx

# **Subtree**

In the tree in data structures, each child from a node shapes a sub-tree recursively and every child in the tree will form a sub-tree on its parent node.

# **Types of Tree in Data Structures**

Here are the different kinds of tree in data structures:

# **General Tree**

The general tree is the type of tree where there are no constraints on the hierarchical structure.

### **Properties**

- The general tree follows all properties of the tree data structure.
- A node can have any number of nodes.

# **Binary Tree**

A binary tree has the following properties:

### **Properties**

- Follows all properties of the tree data structure.
- Binary trees can have at most two child nodes.
- These two children are called the left child and the right child.

# **Binary Search Tree**

A binary search tree is a type of tree that is a more constricted extension of a binary tree data structure.

### **Properties**

- Follows all properties of the tree data structure.
- The binary search tree has a unique property known as the binary search property. This states that the value of a left child node of the tree should be less than or equal to the parent node value of the tree. And the value of the right child node should be greater than or equal to the parent value.
