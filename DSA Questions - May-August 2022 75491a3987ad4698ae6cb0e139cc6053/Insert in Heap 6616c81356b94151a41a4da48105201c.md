# Insert in Heap

## Steps to insert a node in a Heap

1. Insert the node at the last position of the heap (last leaf node) 
    
    where i = size (1-based indexing)
    
2. Place the new node at the correct position
    
    So that the tree follows all the properties of a heap 
    

## To place the node at its correct position

- Find the parent of that node
- Check if value of the node is greater than that of the parent
    - If yes, swap them
    - If not, return
- Place i at the parent node
- Keep doing this until index > 1

```java
public void insert(int val) {
            size = size + 1;
            int index = size;
            arr[index] = val;
            while (index > 1) {
                int parent = index / 2;
                if (arr[parent] < arr[index]) {
                    swap(arr, parent, index);
                    index = parent;
                } else {
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
```
